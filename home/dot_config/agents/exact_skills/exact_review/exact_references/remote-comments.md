# Remote review comments

## Link formats (MR/PR only)

GitLab — diff-line anchor in the Changes tab:
`https://<host>/<project-path>/-/merge_requests/<iid>/diffs#<sha1>_<old>_<new>`
where `<sha1>` = `printf '%s' '<repo-relative-file-path>' | shasum -a 1 | cut -d' ' -f1`
(`shasum` appends two spaces and `-`; the anchor breaks if you paste that) and `<old>`/`<new>` are
the diff positions of the line (walk the hunk from `@@ -o,c +n,c @@`: context lines increment
both counters, `-` only the old, `+` only the new; an added line's `<old>` is the current
unincremented old counter). File-wide notes use `.../diffs#<sha1>`. Fall back to
`https://<host>/<project-path>/-/blob/<source-branch>/<file>#L<line>` only for lines outside
the diff.

GitHub — diff-line anchor in the Files tab:
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<n>/files#diff-<sha256>R<new-line>`
where `<sha256>` = `printf '%s' '<repo-relative-file-path>' | shasum -a 256 | cut -d' ' -f1`;
use `L<old-line>`
for a deleted line. File-wide notes use `...#diff-<sha256>`. Fall back to
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<source-branch>/<file>#L<line>` for lines outside
the diff.
