---

Add a concise, actionable todo item to the TODO.md file at the root of the project.

Instructions:
1. Find the project root by looking for common indicators (.git directory, package.json, etc.)
2. Read the existing TODO.md file if it exists, or create a new one
3. Add the new todo item in a clean, organized format
4. Use the provided prompt argument (if any) to describe the todo item
5. If no prompt is provided, ask the user what todo item they want to add
6. Format the todo as a simple dash list item: `- <description>`
7. Add the todo at the end of the file
8. If the file is empty or new, create a "# TODO" header first
9. Keep entries concise and actionable

The todo item should be clear, specific, and actionable.
